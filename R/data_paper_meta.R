#'
#' @format ## `data_paper_meta` A data frame in long format with one value per
#'   row.
#' \describe{
#'   \item{quality}{Qualitative rating of metric quality. 3 is best, 1 is worst.}
#'   \item{dimension}{Framework dimension}
#'   \item{index}{Framework index}
#'   \item{indicator}{Framework indicator}
#'   \item{keep}{If it stays in the revised metric set, it gets an `x`}
#'   \item{analyze}{If we can reasonable assign a normative value to it (i.e.,
#'   if we can say which direction is good or bad), it gets an `x`}
#'   \item{metric}{Framework metric}
#'   \item{level_of_analysis}{Level or scope that the metric refers to. Options 
#'   are farm, agricultural sector, or population/county/landscape.}
#'   \item{definition}{Longer form definition of the metric, usually pulled
#'   from the source itself.}
#'   \item{resolution}{Smallest geographic scope that the metric can be used at.
#'   This is often county or state, but if spatial data, could also be vector
#'   or the size of raster cells (e.g., 30m).}
#'   \item{updates}{How often the metric is updated from the source}
#'   \item{weighting}{What should be used to weight the variable to treat all
#'   counties equally}
#'   \item{desirable}{If possible, which direction of the metric would represent
#'   an improvement (i.e., what is "good").}
#'   \item{source}{Source of data}
#'   \item{url}{Website where metric can be downloaded from}
#'   \item{notes}{Relevant notes}
#'   \item{status}{Whether metric is fully cleaned, wrangled, etc.}
#'   \item{variable_name}{Unique text identifier for each metric.}
#'   \item{n_states}{Number of states in the Northeast represented by the 
#'   metric. Maximum is 9.}
#'   \item{n_counties}{Number of counties in the Northeast represented by the
#'   metric. While the maximum should technically be 218, it could be 217 if the
#'   metric was only collected before 2022, or 228 if it includes data from both
#'   before and after 2022. This is due to Connecticut changing their county 
#'   system to a governance region system circa 2022.}
#'   \item{n_years}{Number of unique years represented by the metric. Note that 
#'   this is not the range of years. Many metrics are from USDA NASS, which only
#'   collect them every four years.}
#'   \item{latest_year}{Latest year for which data are available}
