Resilient food systems are increasingly recognized as essential, not only in meeting human needs, but in doing so within planetary bounds [@conijnCanOurGlobal2018]. Approximately 42% of world's population depend on agriculture for employment, which is a challenging endeavor in the face of farm consolidation, changing consumption patterns, and climate change [@gillerFutureFarmingWho2021; @aznar-sanchezWorldwideResearchTrends2019]. Food systems themselves are responsible for one-third of greenhouse gas emissions, while anthropogenic climate change has reduced agricultural output by 21% in the last 60 years [@crippaFoodSystemsAre2021; @ortiz-bobeaAnthropogenicClimateChange2021].

Tools for diagnosing and monitoring the sustainability of food systems are thus vital [@fanzo2021ViewpointRigorousMonitoring]. However, there is little consensus on how to define, let alone measure food system sustainability [@allen2016ModelingSustainableFood; @bene2019GlobalMapIndicators]. And while there is an abundance of research at the global level [@bathaei2023SystematicReviewAgricultural; @chaudhary2018MultiindicatorSustainabilityAssessment], there exist gaps in understanding at the local, regional, and landscape levels [@daleLandscapePerspectiveSustainability2012].

The Sustainability Metrics project is an effort to develop both the conceptual and methodological frameworks to define and measure regional food system sustainability in New England. The framework could be used to monitor sustainability over time and inform interventions at the policy and farm levels, creating a healthier and more resilient food system for both social and ecological ends. 

The project is led by the Food Systems Research Institute at the University of Vermont in partnership with, and funded by, the [USDA ARS Food Systems Research Unit](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/burlington-vermont/food-systems-research-unit/) in Burlington, Vermont. Five teams of researchers and numerous community partners are currently conducting primary research on the development and measurement of indicators for food system sustainability. You can find more information about this work at the [UVM FSRI Sustainability Metrics](https://www.uvm.edu/cals/food-systems-research/sustainability-metrics-project) website. For now, what you will find here is a growing collection of secondary data, visualizations, and exploratory analyses to help support the project.

Metadata and citations will be provided throughout the document, but it is worth appreciating the work of the folks at USDA AMS [Food and Agriculture Mapper and Explorer](https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/local-regional/research-publications/fame) in particular, as many of the data shown here were cleaned and compiled in their data warehouse. Considerable inspiration was also taken from the [Food Systems Dashboard](https://www.foodsystemsdashboard.org/), developed by the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition. 

## About FSRI

The Food Systems Research Institute at the University of Vermont is transforming the research landscape by funding collaborative projects that put people and the planet first, break down traditional academic silos and are integrated with and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve, including decision-makers, farmers, and food systems actors. 

Rooted in the belief that no one group can find the answers alone, FSRI empowers researchers to work together across disciplines to address critical issues like soil health, food security, and climate resilience. Instead of funding research that leads to short-term fixes, our commitment is to give researchers the freedom, resources, and time they need to do relevant research that will inform policies, practices, and programs that will long outlast their work. 

FSRI considers the relationship of food systems across scales from local to global and is a partnership between UVM and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS). FSRIâ€™s transdisciplinary approach prioritizes research that studies food systems as a whole, including the networks of people, institutions, physical infrastructure, and natural resources through which food is grown, processed, distributed, sold, prepared, and eaten.
