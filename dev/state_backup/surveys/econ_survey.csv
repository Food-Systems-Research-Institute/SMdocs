Regardless of the increase in output a food system may be experiencing, its sustainability will be jeopardized if there is a declining trend of people engaged in the sector (except that trend plateaus at some point). Except the newly proposed ""precarity index"" is broad enough in scope to capture employment dynamism (which I am not sure), I would propose employee number or some other measure to account for labor market conditions.


I moved ag/crop/farm insurance from ""must include"" category to the ""should include"" because, although insurance is an important ex-ante risk management mechanism, there are also other strategies (such as operations diversification). Furthermore, insurance is not always feasible for some farmers/farming systems (e.g., smaller scale farmers). Additionally, a rise in the frequency and intensity of shocks (especially environmental ones) may increasingly make our present-day traditional insurance schemes less feasible (e.g., we are seeing cases of insurance companies leaving places like California and Florida as there are now more payouts to be made due to frequent disasters, making these companies less profitable). I am not necessarily calling for the removal of insurance from the list of indicators, but just offering some things to think about

I removed ""market place"" from the current list of indicators as I cannot recall what it means. Looking at the original matrix did not also help as there were no metrics for that indicator.

In addition to access to land, I think it may be useful to consider access to credit or some other types of technical or financial resources (except these would be captured in the social dimension). These are important elements of a business ecosystem.","Farmer personal finance,Distribution chain localness,Community economy,Consumer preferences,Food business profitability,Food business resilience,Access to capital / credit","Value from rural landscape,Exogenous factors for business",,,5,,6,2,3,,7,1,4,,1,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
